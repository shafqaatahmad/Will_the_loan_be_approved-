Predict the outcome of loan application using Random Forest and Logistic regression

1.	Define your research/business goal.
The Small Business Administration (SBA) was founded back in 1953 and the purpose of this organization is to provides support to the nation’s economy by enabling the establishments and validity of small businesses and by assisting in the economic recovery of communities after disasters. Because small businesses have been the primary source of job creation in the United States; therefore, it is very important to forecast their economic growth. These loans are made through banks, credit unions, and other lenders who partner with SBA. SBA approved loans come with government-backed guarantees and normally it covers 90% of the guarantees and remaining outstanding balance needs to be covered by the bank. This way, SBA encourages banks not to do background checks on the lenders and provide them a loan. This also provide banks some financial security if a business default, government will pay back majority of the amount. The loans come with very low-interest rates.1 
As small businesses are awarded loans, but there is no guarantee of success in the business. From 2006 through 2015 more than 17.4% loans went into default that is 1 in every 6 loans. This is still an improvement. All the SBA backed loans ending in 2008 nearly had 24.7% of default rate.2 However, banks still face a dilemma if they should lend the amount given small businesses there are high chances of defaulting on a loan.2 
SBA provided this dataset which contains the historical data back from 1962 till 2014. This dataset has 28 different variables and 899,164 observations. Our goal underlying goal is to determine if the loan will be approved or denied for certain small businesses. We will also be studying the impact of Great Recession on loan default or approval rates. We will take industry codes classification, geographical region, and risk indicators into our consideration as working through this dataset. We will be building logistic regression, classification rules, and decision trees in order to predict the output. 

2.	Briefly describe the queries (research/business questions) you want to address. Limit the number of queries to a maximum of four.
•	Will the loan be approved or not?
•	Which industry and region has highest loan approval and charge off rate?
•	How recession impacted on loans?
•	What is charge off or default rate for new and old businesses?
